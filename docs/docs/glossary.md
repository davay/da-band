| Serial Peripheral Interace (SPI)                   | A protocol for synchronous wired communication between devices through 4 types of logic signals (CS, SCLK, MOSI, MISO) implemented using 4 wires.<br><br>Follows a master-slave architecture where the main device controls communication with other devices through using clock and chip select signals.<br><br>Data flows in a circle; MOSI then MISO and so on. Data packets usually contain just raw data; no overhead necessary.<br><br>Usually implemented as a hardware on the MCU, but can be done in software too. There are also often pins on the module to interface with the SPI. |
| Logic Signals                                      | Electrical signals that represent binary values (0 or 1) through voltage level — e.g., in a 5V system, voltages close to 5V would represent ‘1’ and 0V would represent ‘0’.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
