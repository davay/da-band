1. There are two project here, one is bluetooth-test, the other one is da-band-new,
bluetooth-test can directly use by copy, it is not a tuist project. I cloned Devin's previous
tuist project to work on da-band-new. So it should be a tuist project.

2. For bluetooth-test, you need to connect with your phone and enable bluetooth and developer mode first.

3. A lot of stuff is diconnected with da-band-new, it won't work properly for now.
